# Project7

Project 7 is creating a binary search tree, where integers will be inserted according to their value.
Our group will have a binarytree.h file which will contain the sturct with an integer and a pointer to the root of the tree. I twill also contain all the function declarations for the rest of the project. 
Our main.c file will read integers from a file on the comman lilne and insert them into the binary tree. Using the fuction calls we will then print out the order, pre order, and post order, as well as the number of elements, tree height, and if a specified number is found.
As well we will have a script file and a makefile.
